# Placement of NFT Items in the Field

Players start Aurum production by placing their NFT items on tiles on the islands. Each NFT item has a specific production capacity and time cycle. NFTs are categorized into Tier 1, Tier 2, and Tier 3 according to their production capacity, with each level offering different profit rates.

- **Tier 1 NFTs:** Low production capacity, ideal for beginner players. Commonly used on early stage islands such as Aurora Terra.
- **Tier 2 NFTs:** Have a higher production capacity, giving them an advantage on advanced islands such as Novaris City. Increases earning potential by offering more Aurum production.
- **Tier 3 NFTs:** Have the highest production capacity and are used on advanced islands such as Valkyrium Nexus. Provides maximum Aurum production and additional bonuses.

The placement of NFTs should be optimized depending on the strategic planning of the players. Players can efficiently manage their islands by using different combinations of NFTs to increase their production capacity.
