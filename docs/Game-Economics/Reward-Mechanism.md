# Reward Mechanism

MoveTopia's reward mechanism allows players to generate resources through their in-game activities and turn these resources into earnings. The reward cycle works like this:

## NFT to Aurum

Players generate Aurum periodically through the NFT items they place on their land.

## Aurum to MoveTopia Token:

The generated Aurum is staked through the reward pool and earns players $TOPIA tokens on a weekly basis. The distribution of rewards in the reward pool is managed by the DAO and shaped by community voting.

The prize pool is a cornerstone of the MoveTopia economy, providing players with a sustainable earning model.
