# NFTs

NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) are the fundamental building blocks of MoveTopia's in-game economy. They are unique digital assets that players use to develop their islands, increase production and earn rewards through staking mechanisms.

## Types of NFTs

- Land (Lands Plots)
- Aurora Terra is a piece of land owned on the islands of Novaris City and Valkyrium Nexus.
- They come in 10x10 tile areas and players can unlock tiles using Glister.
- Different islands have different production capacities and each one offers different earning levels.

## Equipment

- Specialized NFTs used in farming, power generation and other production processes.
- Example: Trees, Energy reactors, high-tech farming systems.
- Each of them produces depending on a specific time cycle.

## Booster NFTs

- Auxiliary NFTs used in-game to speed up production processes or increase profits.
- Instant Reset: Accelerates production by resetting counters.
- Time Warp: Reduces production time by X%.
- Yield Amplifier: Increases Aurum production for a certain period of time.

NFTs can be bought, staked and traded in-game.
