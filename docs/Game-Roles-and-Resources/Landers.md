# Landers (Players)

Landers are players who first step into the MoveTopia universe and start developing their islands. Each player initially owns a piece of land and farms it, making strategic decisions. Landers use various resources and NFT items to increase their earnings and achieve greater goals in MoveTopia.

## Tasks

- Gathering resources and production on the islands.
- Create fertile areas by opening Tiles (Aurora Terra).
- Staking earned resources to get $TOPIA tokens.
- Participate in community decisions with AP points.

In shaping their land, Landers have the opportunity to both make individual gains and contribute to the MoveTopia community.
