# Aurum

Aurum is MoveTopia's main production resource and plays a key role in increasing players' in-game earnings. This resource is produced from NFT items on players' lands and varies according to the production capacity of each land.

## Manufacturing

Aurum is generated from NFT items that players place on the islands at specific time intervals.

- **Aurora Terra:** Low production capacity.
- **Novaris City:** Medium production capacity.
- **Valkyrium Nexus:** High production capacity.

## Areas of Use

Aurum allows players to earn $TOPIA tokens with weekly rewards by staking through the Omnium Core. The weight in the staking pool determines the amount of rewards players receive. This resource is the main way for players to increase their in-game economic power.
