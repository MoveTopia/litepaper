# Voting Processes

Voting processes, one of the core functions of the DAO mechanism, support the democratic nature of MoveTopia. Each player can participate in community voting and play an active role in important decisions of the game, depending on the AP points they collect.

## How does it work?

- DAO voting is organized periodically or according to community needs.
- Players have weighted voting rights based on their AP points.
- Votes are aggregated through Omnium Core to reflect the collective decisions of the community.

## Voting Topics

- Opening of new islands.
- Updates to the game economy and NFT mechanics.
- Special events and in-game campaigns.

DAO's voting mechanism allows players to contribute to the development of MoveTopia not only individually but also as a community. Players can actively participate in shaping the game world in line with the shared goals of the community.
