# Ascension Pulse (AP)

Ascension Pulse (AP) is a point system that underpins MoveTopia's strategic decision-making. AP is a resource that allows players to have a voice in the community, increasing their influence in the game.

## How to Earn?

- All NFT items give AP Points, such as the ones I have given AURUM.
- Quests and achievements give players additional AP points (for example, reaching the Valkyrium Nexus or developing tiles).
- The AP gain depends on the player's strategic planning and activity in the game.

## Areas of Use

- Provides weighted voting rights in DAO voting.
- Increases players' reputation and influence in the community.
- Used to influence decisions such as opening new islands, game economy changes or organizing special events.

AP is not just an in-game score, but also represents the player's influence in community decisions and the power to shape the future of MoveTopia.
