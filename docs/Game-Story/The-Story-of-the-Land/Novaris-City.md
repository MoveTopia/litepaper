# Novaris City

Novaris City is MoveTopia's second land that represents modernization and offers an advanced earning system for players. Unlike Aurora Terra, here all tiles are open to players and players can start earning directly by placing their items. This land represents a living space full of modernization and technology, where players can take their utopia further.

The earning rates in Novaris City are significantly higher than in Aurora Terra. On the land, players can increase their earnings by placing thematic and advanced NFT items such as factories, schools and hospitals. These items not only increase Aurum (Gold) production, but also allow players to make their utopia more advanced and efficient. Furthermore, some items also provide players with Glister and Ascension Pulse (AP) bonuses, offering additional benefits for long-term goals.

Novaris City is an environment where players can increase their earning capacity while also shaping their utopia with a more comprehensive vision. Filled with modern buildings and infrastructure, this city not only provides more profit, but also allows players to develop their ability to think strategically and utilize their resources more effectively. Novaris City is an ideal stage to prepare for goals in the advanced levels of MoveTopia.
