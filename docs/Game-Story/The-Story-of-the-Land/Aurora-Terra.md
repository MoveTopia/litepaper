# Aurora Terra

Aurora Terra is the starting point of MoveTopia and is where players first step into this fascinating world. Each player starts with 50 Glysters and can immediately begin sculpting their land. The surface of the land initially appears as a barren wasteland, but that's just the beginning; it's a potential waiting to come to life with the players' touch.

Each area (tile) on the land is initially closed and can be opened and transformed into fertile land for 5 Glister. This transformation makes it possible for players to take the first steps towards profit. NFT items can be placed in these opened areas; entry-level items such as trees, tractors, and other basic vehicles produce Aurum at regular intervals and provide income for players.

Aurora Terra is both a place for players to learn the basic mechanics of the game and a starting point for earning their first income. Through a cycle of tile unlocking and item placement, players can develop the land, increase their earnings, and prepare to achieve greater goals in MoveTopia. This land trains players in both strategy and resource management and lays a solid foundation for success on further land.
