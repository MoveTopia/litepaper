# Journey of the Players

Players, aka Landers, embark on a grand adventure when they step into MoveTopia. Everyone gets an initial plot of land, where they make strategic decisions to build their own utopia. Players go through the following stages:

## Start

- In Aurora Terra, they take the first steps and learn basic mechanics.
- They place low-level NFT items to start resource production.

## Discovery and Development

- They explore new islands for more resources and profits.
- They buy and place NFT items that increase their production capacity.

## Targets

- Using the collected resources, they earn $TOPIA staking rewards and increase their Ascension Pulse (AP) points.
- By participating in the game's DAO mechanisms, they influence the community's decisions.
