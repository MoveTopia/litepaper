# Discovery of MoveTopia

A mysterious dimension beyond time and space with “infinite potential” has been discovered: MoveTopia.

In this dimension, there are many different islands, each shaped by its own timeline, technological level or unique thematic features. This fascinating world offers not only a land full of resources, but also a limitless universe where players can build their own utopia.

MoveTopia offers players both the thrill of discovery and the strategic process of building. Each player begins their adventure in Aurora Terra, the starting point when they step into this dimension. Over time, by collecting resources and refining their strategy, they have the chance to reach more advanced islands such as Novaris City and Valkyrium Nexus.
