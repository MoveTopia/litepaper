# Vision

MoveTopia's core vision is to provide players with a sustainable gaming ecosystem that provides both a fun experience and profit. This vision is centered around five core principles:

1. **FUN:** MoveTopia is a game world that you will enjoy above all else.
2. **OWNERSHIP:** Players have complete control over the NFTs and resources they own.
3. **GAME ECONOMY:** A simple and sustainable economic system offers players the opportunity to create value.
4. **ECOSYSTEM AND COMMUNITY:** A community-based structure allows players to take an active role in the development of the game.
5. **DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization):** A democratic system that allows players to directly influence community decisions.
